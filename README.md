# Overview
This project is an unsolicited entry for an employment code challenge I found online.  While I am not applying for the job, the challenge looked interesting enough just to do in order to learn something new.... in this case actually learning how to implement a REST API using Flask, and integrate it with other programming languages.  Also, learn how to integrate with Travis-CI, codecov.io, and CDash.

I cannot reveal the company this challenge is for - they ask that their name not be used lest other candidates find a submitted solution and draw inspiration from it (if not outright plagarize it).

However the conditions of this challenge are pretty cool.  The code remains the property of the applicant and they encourage it's inclusion into the applicants portfolio... even to use to it present to other employers.

This is pretty progressive thinking.  It stands in stark contrast to some other parasitic creatures at unethical organizations that essentially are using code challenges as a source of free labor.  

I encourage you to check it out and see if it has anything to affer you.  It is released under the GPL v3.  The Flask extension under the simplified BSD license.
